Maintenance Data Management System- Project

In this project, we design a database for maintenance department of a company. There customers, employees, technical staff, products, categories, complaints, repairments,and so on. Customers will be able to file a request for repairments of their products. Whole process  will  be  kept  track  of  to  monitor  progress  in  each  step.  Customers  can  also  file  a complaint   about   products.   Such   complaints  will   be   handled   by   customer   services. Conversation between customers and employees should also be recorded
